FORUM for AppEngine
===================

Welcome and thanks for downloading FORUM.

Installing FORUM is simple, just drop the folder in any Google AppEngine application and add the following line to your app.yaml file:

    includes:
    - forum/forum.yaml

That's it! It should work flawlessly. To try it out, just point your browser to yourapp/forum and you will see the welcome page with an empty list of forums. To start adding forums, go to yourapp/forum/admin using your Google ID since you will be the only administrator. From there click on 'Forum Setup' and add as many forums as you like. When done, go back to the main forum page and from there people will be able to start posting topics and messages.

FORUM is an ongoing project with many more features coming along. Remember to check back once in a while for updates, or fork it if you want to improve it yourself.

Thanks again for using FORUM and feel free to send us any suggestions or bugs you may encounter.


FORUM TEAM.
